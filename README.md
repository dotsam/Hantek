Hantek 2D72 handheld oscillosope tool for linux

This is an unofficial implementation of a graphical tool to manage Hantek2D72 handheld oscilloscope.

The official tool is only for Windows, so I've developed this tool for personal use and I've decided to share it!

I've tested the tool only with my oscilloscope, so I don't guarantee it works with others.

The use of this tool is at youw own risk, I don't grant its safety!
